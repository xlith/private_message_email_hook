# private_message_email_hook

tl;dr
Email module for Drupal based Opigno LMS's private messages.

## Descriptipn

In one our projects we need to send notification emails to the users who recivied a private message. But we had a problem integrating email sending module to the Drupal's Private Message module. So we had to code this simple module.
This module creates a config page under `configuration > private message > private message email hook ` menu.

In this config admin can:

- Enable/disable module
- Set title of the outgoing mail
- Set body of the outgoing mail

## Dependencies

- drupal/private_message
